# Jumper-game

The game starts by selecting a secret word randomly chosen from a list.
The player then guesses a letter. If the guess is correct, the letter is revealed.
If the guess is incorrect, a line is cut on the player's parachute.
The game ends when you guess all the letters correctly or when the player
has no more parachute.
